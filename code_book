This page describes the variables and data analyzed, as well as the changes that were made to them in order to create a tidy dataframe.

The data analyzed are the records of activities carried out by people who had a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone through different sensors. The data obtained from these measurements is divided into two data sets, one for training and the other for testing. The idea of this analysis is to join all the data in a single frame to be able to analyze them and present at the end a data frame summarizing the means and standard deviation of the measured variables.
